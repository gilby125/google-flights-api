# Progress Report

## Current Status (2025-03-31)
*   Core API handlers implemented (`api/handlers.go`).
*   Database schemas defined (`db/postgres.go`, `db/neo4j.go`).
*   Queue implementation exists (`queue/redis.go`).
*   Worker and scheduler components exist (`worker/`).
*   Docker setup exists (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`), updated to include Neo4j service and basic API env vars.
*   Refactoring for testability of DB interactions completed:
    *   Updated `db.PostgresDB` and `db.Neo4jDatabase` interfaces.
    *   Refactored `api/handlers.go` to use new DB interface methods.
    *   Updated mocks in `test/mocks/` for new interfaces.
*   Unit testing added for several API handlers (`test/unit/api/handlers_test.go`).
*   Previous testing gaps identified (see below).

## Next Steps to Run the Application
1.  **Verify/Document Environment Configuration:** Identify and document all required environment variables (Postgres credentials, Neo4j credentials, Redis URL/credentials, API keys, etc.) in `README.md`, based on `config/config.go`.
2.  **Confirm Docker Compose Setup:** Double-check `docker-compose.yml` for correct service definitions, links, ports, and volumes for Postgres, Neo4j, Redis, and the Go app.
3.  **Database Seeding:** Confirm if `db/seed.go` needs to be run initially and document the process in `README.md`.
4.  **Build Process:** Document the command to build the Go application binary (e.g., `go build .`) in `README.md`.
5.  **Running the App:** Document the command to start all services (e.g., `docker-compose up -d --build`) in `README.md`.
6.  **Testing Connectivity:** Add steps to `README.md` to verify the application can connect to Postgres, Neo4j, and Redis after starting.

## Known Issues/Blockers for Running
*   Required environment variables (`DB_PASSWORD`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`) need to be set by the user.
*   Database seeding process (`db/seed.go`) needs confirmation and documentation.
*   End-to-end run instructions in `README.md` need to be created/updated.

## Previously Identified Testing Gaps (Needs Prioritization)
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   `test/integration/get_search_test.go`: Missing tests for database connection errors, input validation (long strings, special characters, SQL injection), and full response body validation.
    *   `test/integration/search_results_test.go`: Missing tests for empty offers/segments, partial data, different currencies, and large number of offers/segments.
    *   `test/integration/search_test.go`: Missing tests for invalid airport codes, number of adults, class, and all possible values for the `Stops` parameter.
*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   `test/unit/worker/scheduler_test.go`: Missing tests for job retries, job cancellation, concurrency, error handling (full queue), and persistence.
    *   `test/unit/worker/manager_test.go`: Missing tests for worker availability, job prioritization, error handling (scheduler errors), and configuration.
    *   `test/unit/worker/worker_test.go`: Missing tests for data validation, and the `processPriceGraphSearch` and `validateCronExpression` methods.
    *   `test/unit/api/handlers_test.go`: Remaining handlers need tests (job management, bulk search retrieval, price history).
*   **Mocks:**
    *   `test/mocks/postgres_mock.go`: Mocking for complex scenarios (nested rows, specific transaction errors) might need enhancement.
    *   `test/mocks/mocks.go`: Neo4j mock (`MockNeo4jResult`) needs refinement for realistic iteration simulation. Scheduler mock might be needed for job enable/disable tests.
