## Next Steps

1. Complete the search implementation
2. Implement bulk search functionality
3. Develop the admin panel interface
4. Add seed data for airports and airlines
5. Implement price history endpoints
6. Set up monitoring for workers and queue

## Notes

- The dates in this document are approximate and for tracking purposes only
- Priority should be given to completing the core search functionality before expanding to additional features
- Regular updates to this document will help track progress and identify bottlenecks
