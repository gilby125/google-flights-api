# Worker-only deployment for distributed flight scraping
# Deploy this to multiple servers to spread the load
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file and .env.worker.example to your remote server
#   2. Configure .env.worker with your central Redis/Postgres connection details
#   3. Run: docker compose -f docker-compose.worker.yml up -d
#
# Each server will:
#   - Connect to your central Redis queue
#   - Pull jobs and process them
#   - Write results to your central PostgreSQL
#   - NOT run the scheduler (leader election ensures only one instance does)
